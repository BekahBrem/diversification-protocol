# diversification-protocol

This project is my final year project for my computer science BSc (Hons) at King's College London. 

It's based on the implementation of a Diversification protocol put forward by Nan Kang, Frederik Mallmann-Trenn and Nicol√°s Rivera in their 2021 paper titled: "Diversity, Fairness, and Sustainability in Population Protocols"

The implementation allows a user to simulate a run of this protocol and see it behaving in real-time, or run it many times to recieve a report of the results.
