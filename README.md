# Final Year Project: diversification-protocol

This project is my final year project for my computer science BSc (Hons) at King's College London. 

It's based on the implementation of a Diversification protocol put forward by Nan Kang, Frederik Mallmann-Trenn and Nicol√°s Rivera in their 2021 paper titled: "Diversity, Fairness, and Sustainability in Population Protocols"

The implementation allows a user to simulate a run of this protocol and see it behaving in real-time, or run it many times to receive a report of the results.

# Instructions to run:

## Step 1: Ensure that your system uses python 3.

## Step 2: Install packages and dependencies, using pip:
(For alternative installations, please check the associated website of each package, linked next to the name of the package)

    Install by entering the following in your command line: 
    
        pip install networkx[default]

tkinter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
    Install by entering the following in your command line: 
        
        pip install tk

mycolorpy (https://github.com/binodbhttr/mycolorpy)
    Install by entering the following in your command line: 
        
        pip install mycolorpy

## Step 3: Navigate to the root folder of the project called diversification-protocol

## Step 4: type the following in the command line (ensuring that it's configured to use python 3): python userParameters.py


## To run unit tests simply write the following in the command line: python -m unittest file_name
